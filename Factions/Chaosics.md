#Complete
The Chaosics are less of a faction and more of a race, they are the deities of the Multiverse.
Some are representative of concepts such as [[Time]] and [[Space]]. Others have specific reigns over certain groups, like [[Nightmare]] and the [[Elementals]], or [[Characters/Character Files/Galactus|Galactus]] and the [[Afterborn]].

##### History
Originally the Multiverse didn't exist (shock horror /s) as didn't the passage of time. With a spark, the first two Chaosics came into existence, [[Caelum]] and [[Gehenna]], the first two beings. From the ideals of those two came the Conjurer and the Destroyer, [[Vita]] and [[Mors]]. These four formless existences "lived" for the indefinite amount of time before came the arrival of the last four Chaosics, Bringers of Balance and of Instability, [[Nightmare]] and [[Characters/Character Files/Galactus|Galactus]], and the two Guardians of what would be [[Universes/Locations Outside Universes/THE PLANE|THE PLANE]] of the Multiverse, [[Space]] and [[Time]].

After Space had brought creation to its namesake and named it [[Universes/Locations Outside Universes/THE PLANE|THE PLANE]], the eldest four Chaosics were reborn from their once metaphysical forms into physical ones. [[Vita]] and [[Mors]] were assigned to create and maintain the Universes inside the Multiverse, while [[Nightmare]] and [[Characters/Character Files/Galactus|Galactus]] worked to uphold it's inhabitants, they did so by creating and being the Guardians of two widespread imperfect mortal groups, the [[Elementals]] for [[Nightmare]], and the [[Afterborn]] for [[Galactus]].

##### Goals
- [[Caelum]] - Spreading Virtue and Selflessness among its fellow beings
- [[Gehenna]] - Spreading Sin and Selfishness among its fellow beings
- [[Vita]] - Giving life and inspiring exploration among their fellow beings
- [[Mors]] - Giving death and discouraging exploration among their fellow beings
- [[Nightmare]] - Maintaining Balance and justice among his fellow beings
- [[Characters/Character Files/Galactus|Galactus]] - Maintaining Instability and justice among his fellow beings
- [[Space]] - Sharing the ability to expierence among their fellow beings
- [[Time]] - Limiting the ability to expierence among their fellow beings

##### Conflicts
Naturally, because of the conflicting [[#Goals]] of the Chaosics, disputes and wars against one another are a given. Three (relevant to UniLuck) examples are the [[The War on Night]], [[The NRF]] and the [[Chaos Capture]]. By far the most conflicts were started by [[Nightmare]] and [[Characters/Character Files/Galactus|Galactus]] or [[Vita]] and [[Mors]].
