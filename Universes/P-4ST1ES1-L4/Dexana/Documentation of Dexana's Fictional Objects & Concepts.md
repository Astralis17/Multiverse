#### Caerium
Caerium is a fictional substance within the universe of [[Dexana]], it is heavily used and exploited by the local population for many purposes.
Large amounts of Caerium concentrated in one place, can noticeably affect the nearby gravity in order to induce a sort of a anti-gravity or artificial gravity effect, this is used in [[#Starliners]] to provide lift in order to achieve flight.
It also has a very unique decay series that can easily be looped back into itself with the use of nuclear fusion and chemistry, this in addition to it's reactive properties makes it a efficient and sustainable power source.
Due to large quantities of Caerium causing gravity to warp, it is difficult to transport.

 The name is derived from the suffix "ium" and the word "Caeruleum"

Its decaying nature can be used with more technology to produce energy at quite a large scale. Large quantities of the substance can warp gravity in interesting ways which can be used to create artificial gravity"

##### Spaceports
Spaceports are similar to airports and seaports, except instead of serving as a travel point between air/sea and land, it's a travel point between the ground and space. Serving as an important location for any beings of [[Dexana]] that wish to travel through it's local [[The Solar System|Star System]].
Typically there are several terminals in a Spaceport, in order to allow multiple [[#Starliners]] to dock and be boarded, though sometimes there may be a single terminal for smaller Spaceports in lower population areas.
##### Starliners
Starliners are to [[#Spaceports]] as Airplanes are to Airports, they are spaceships that cruise the stars to bring passengers & cargo between [[#Spaceports]] on different planets within [[The Solar System]]. They are powered with [[#Caerium]] reactors and ion engines to provide the necessary propulsion
###### Commercial
Commercial [[#Starliners]] are used to transport passengers and small amounts of cargo.
###### Freighters
Freighters are a type of [[#Starliners|Starliner]] explicitly used for transporting cargo.
#### UVS Glass
*UVS* Glass or *Ultra Violet Solar* Glass, is a glass that absorbs UV light from the [[The Solar System#The Star|Local Star]] and converts it into usable energy, effectively being a solar panel for light that humans cannot see due to this, it's predominantly used in the construction of buildings in [[Externa]], which have a lot glass and surface area.
It also adds an extra layer of privacy as those who use UV light filters cannot see through it.
