The Conglomerate is another meganation spanning roughly a quarter of the [[Dulan & Planet 2#Dulan|Dulanan]] globe, it's a collection of companies who work together to run the nation, there is much less freedom here in comparison to [[The Federation]], with most of it's inhabitants being stuck in the abusive corporate lifestyle.
It's a bleak life to live under The Conglomerate with it's brutal and classist systems.
It's almost always at political or physical war with [[The Federation]] and it's opposing views of the perfect society.
