#Incomplete #Astralis #Rander
[[#Dulan]] & [[#Planet2]] are in a binary planetary system, orbiting each other and then the star of the solar system in which they reside.
Every 90 days the two planets complete a full cycle around each other, with about 5 days where one planet fills the sky of the other planet, plunging it into darkness. 


#### Dulan
Dulan is inhabited by a fairly modern society of humans with global politics in disarray and juxtaposition
The planet is essentially split into three sections, [[The Federation]]; a somewhat just democracy, [[The Conglomerate]]; a brutal classist oligarchy and [[The Outlands]], the anarchial wastelands, ruled by no-one group.
#### Planet2


#### The Moon
There is a single moon that orbits the two planets, it swaps between each planet every cycle.


#### Religion
Due to the cycle of alternating darkness and the unique behaviour of [[#The Moon]], there are two main religions who's holy time is based of the alternating periods of darkness, when [[#Dulan]] fills the day sky of [[#Planet2]] it is the time of Lumanians, and when [[#Dulan]]'s day sky is filled, it is the time of the Tenebrisians.
