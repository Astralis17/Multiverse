The Outlands are made up of the remaining area/land on [[Dulan & Planet 2#Dulan|Dulan]] that is not occupied by [[The Federation]] and [[The Conglomerate]], some call it an anarchial hellscape, some call it the wastes of true freedom, but others call it home.
Here, everyone is on their own, there is no centralised government, there is no rule. The only laws that exist are the ones that each individual groups set by themselves for themselves.
