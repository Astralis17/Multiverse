#Incomplete 
Throughout the world of Multiverse there are many universes. (Shocker I know /s)
There are also several Dimensions within said universes and also outside of them, some of these Dimensions are classified as [[Hell's Pockets]] and [[Angelic Pockets]] which are pocket dimensions that Angels and Demons cannot enter respectively

- [[#Classification & IDing Universes]]



#### List of Universes 
The Universes are as follows
- [[FILENAME00]]
- [[UniDark]] 
- [[UniLuck]]
- [[UniDust]]
- [[Dexana]]
- [[Andria]]
- [[Rander]]
- [[Yndarium]]
#### Notable Dimensions
- [[Hyrule]]

#### Classification & IDing Universes

##### Step 1: Which part of the Multiverse does it exist in?
```Location
PLAINE = P-
Outerverses = O-
Interverses = I-
```
##### Step 2: Determine the distance from the North Point in quadrants
```
1-4
```
☆If not in the PLAINE, ignore this step
##### Step 3: Determine the Directional Co-ordinates (i)
```Quadrant/ID
Quadrant/ID
1/NT1
2/NT2
3/ST2
4/ST1
```
☆If in the Outerverses, skip this step
##### Step 4: Determine the Directional Co-ordinates (ii)
```Distance-from-the-EzWiz-Line
Distance from the EzWiz Line
WS4 WS3 WS2 WS1 | ES1 ES2 ES3 ES4
```
☆Again, skip this if in the Outerverses
##### Step 5: Status
```Universe-Statuses
Universe Statuses
Living = -L
Dormant = -NL
Living Cluster = -LC
Dormant Cluster = -NLC
```

##### Step 6: Amount of Universes in Geometric
☆Skip this if in the Outerverses or Interverses
##### Step 7: Add the MT-ID acronym to the end


##### Example
UniLuck
- In [[THE PLAINE]]
	- **P-**
- 3 Quarters from the North Point
	- P-**3**ST2**
- Quadrant ID is ST2
	- P-3**ST2**
- 3 Sectors East of the EzWiz Line
	- P-3ST2**ES3**
- It's Living and not a Universe Cluster
	- P-3ST2ES3**-L**
- There is 3 Universes in it's local Geometric
	- P-3ST2ES3-L**3**
- The MT-ID is UL
	- P-3ST2ES3-L**UL**

P-3ST2ES3-L3UL - UniLuck
