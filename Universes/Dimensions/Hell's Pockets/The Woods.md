#Incomplete 
_The Woods_ is the [[Multiversal Travellers]] common name for a widespread [[Hell's Pockets]] that spans over multiple [[Universes]] in multiple [[Geometrics]]. Most of the time, it takes the form of a thick forest, within a _Universe_, that can warp a person's location from one Universe to the next. It's generally regarded as a benign _Hell's Pocket_, as it itself does not pose immediate threat, although those few who have settled within it's maze can be extremely dangerous to anyone passing by. _The Woods_ are a highly unpredictable dimension, that only sometimes enacts on it's anomalous properties, seemingly targeting certain individuals. The most common locations _The Woods_ can transport people to, is different parts of their planet, other planets in their Universe, or other Universes in the same _Geometric_, but in extreme cases can even lead to _external Universes_. Some notable groups that have made The Woods include the _[[The Elementals of UniDark]], [[the Resident]] of UniLuck, the [[Crystal Guard]], The survivors hideouts of UniDust, and the Dragon den of UniLuck._ The _origin demon_ who once ruled over _The Woods_ is unknown, as it's thought that it has existed for a very long time, which does technically describe the dimension as an Vacant Hell's Pocket. _It's full classification is a **3rd Quadrant Eastern Vacant-Benign MRN Hell's Pocket.
