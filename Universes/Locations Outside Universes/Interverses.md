#Incomplete 
The Interverses are somewhat of a counterpart to the [[Outerverses]], albeit only somewhat.
It is the place where defective or unstable universes are sent by [[Mors]] to protect the other [[Universes]], due to this non-[[Chaosics]] cannot enter or leave the Interverses.
Seeing as no-one bar the [[Chaosics]] can enter or leave the Interverses, there are no [[Multiversal Travellers]] here

All of the [[Universes]] within the Interverses are in one large [[Geometrics|Geometric]], which is incredibly unstable as the universes within it are unstable themselves.
Universes that are sent here collapse and obliterate shortly (in Multiversal terms).

It's positioned in the center of the [[THE PLAINE]]
