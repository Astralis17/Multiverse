#Incomplete 
The Outerverses are somewhat of a counterpart to the [[Interverses]], albeit only somewhat.
Similarly to the [[Interverses]], exiting the Outerverses is not possible, though it is possible to enter them.
In sharp juxtaposition to the [[Interverses]], there are no [[Geometrics]] here whatsoever.
There are [[Multiversal Travellers]] here and they are typically more experienced than [[Multiversal Travellers|MTs]] in the  [[THE PLAINE]].
The inhabitants of [[Universes]] within the Outerverses are usually more knowledgeable of the [[Chaosics]]
It's structured fundamentally different to the universes of [[THE PLAINE]]
