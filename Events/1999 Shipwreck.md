#Incomplete 

In 1999, UniLuck years, an Elemental mission was carried out, it sent out a ship with 6 Elementals on board; Water, Fire, Ice, Nature, Earth and Lies. On the way home from this mission, the group encountered a tsunami that flooded their boat. 5 of the 6 Elementals on that boat died because of the waves, but the last remaining one managed to steer the ship home. That Elemental, the Lies Elemental, never told anyone his story, and he fled from the Elementals. He never returned back, instead settling for a life away from the group, and, because of his Element, efforts weren't exasperated to try and find him, he wasn't the head of a suit like the rest of his, now fallen, comrades, and so he was just let go.

The fallen Elementals would pass their abilities to the next generation, which would be nicknamed [[Generation '99]].
