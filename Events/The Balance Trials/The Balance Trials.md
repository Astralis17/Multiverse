#Incomplete 

The Balance Trials are a collection of events during the year 2013UL, that happened due to [[Geometrics|Geometric]] [[P-3ST2ES3-L3]] destabilising which would've lead to catastrophic results if the problem was not resolved.
3 duo counterparts from the universes had to work together to progress through the trials to stabilise the [[Geometrics|Geometric]].
[[Belle Riddle]], [[Calypso Riddle]] and [[Dark Riddle]] are all counterparts from the universes making up one side of the three duos with [[Link H. Henderson]], [[Lee Riddle]] and [[Ben Schmit]].
There were a total of 6 trials that took place to stabilise the [[Geometrics|Geometric]]
- [[Trial 1 - Light and Dark]]
- [[Trial 2 - UniSwap]]
- [[Trial 3 - Prison Breakout]]
- [[Trial 4 - Kidnapped Court]]
- [[Trial 5 - Tunnel of Fear]]
- [[Trial 6 - Flip the Switch]]
