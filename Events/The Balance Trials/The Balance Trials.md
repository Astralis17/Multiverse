#Incomplete 

The Balance Trials are a collection of events that happened due to geometric [[P-3ST2ES3-L3]] destabilising which would've lead to catastrophic results if the problem was not fixed
3 duo counterparts from the universes had to work together to progress through the trials to stabilise the geometric
[[Belle Riddle]], [[Calypso Riddle]] and [[Dark Riddle]] are all counterparts from the universes making up one side of the three duos with [[Link H. Henderson]], [[Lee Riddle]] and [[Ben Schmit]][^1]

There were a total of 6 trials that took place to stabilise the Geometric
- [[Trial 1 - Light and Dark]]
- [[Trial 2 - UniSwap]]
- [[Trial 3 - Prison Breakout]]
- [[Trial 4 - Kidnapped Court]]
- [[Trial 5 - Tunnel of Fear]]
- [[Trial 6 - Flip the Switch]]

[^1]: I (Aurora) am unsure if it was [[Ben Schmit]] but he is the only character from [[UniDark]] that has been tagged so I can only assume he is the Link counterpart
