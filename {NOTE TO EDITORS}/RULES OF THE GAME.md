#### **3:** (You might not think I needed to add this one but) No pokemon based characters

#### **4:** No bending rules (for obvious reasons)

#### **5:** If you want to add or change something consult with the group (unless it involves only your own characters, then just let the rest know)

#### **6:** All new members must be borrowed the Multiverse Handbook

#### **7:** There's no stupid questions, ever or at all
