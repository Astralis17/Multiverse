The Portal Skull was made by [[Tula Ossa Hellsing]] to act as both a key and door to her grave, being able to be used by anyone. 
#### Type of Tool
Being a transport tool, its combat uses are limited, but for its intended purpose of being able to take someone to [[Tula Ossa Hellsing]]'s grave, and then bring them back to their original location, or another set location it works perfectly.
#### Description 
A semi-large skull of one of Tula's test subjects, the skull has rune like engravings and symbols all connected, with a faint light blue glow that emanates from the inside of these engravings. Apart from the symbols and the glow, it looks like a normal skull.
#### Aspects 
The Skull emanates a faint light blue glow, which is the soul circuits of the skull. The Skull is reusable, as it contains over 100 other souls taken from the Paris Catacombs as a form of battery for multiple uses with out breaking or running out of power. 
#### History 
The Skull belonged to Mackle Shanks, a murderer that was sentenced to death. Tula kidnapped him on his day of execution to be used in human tests, the tests he experienced was one were while alive Tula, used her experience as a doctor to engrave the symbols on his body and bones to try and transport the body without being warped. This half worked, as the teleportation was successful but the cost left his body to wither, but alive and with the damage to his soul leaving him unable to move, but allowed him to store souls inside his bones similar to how Tula survives. Once his body died Tula removed his flesh and started to engraved more complex and powerful symbols, allowing her to turn parts of his body into tools and transportation devices. While alive he is closer to a conscious person in a coma, unable to move feel or talk but still able to think, only being able to be heard during travel of others.
