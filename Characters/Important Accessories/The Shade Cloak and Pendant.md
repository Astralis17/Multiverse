#### The Shade Cloak
The Shade Cloak was an ordinary cloak that was bought by [[Xes]] in [[Externa]], the cloak served as nothing more than apparel for many years until the event which caused [[Xes]] to end up in [[UniLuck]] when during the short jaunt in [[The Woods]] it gained magical properties and sentience.

The Cloak is made of a shadowy material which flows and shifts constantly, it is sentient but it's only form of communication is in Norse Runes which requires a lot of interpretation to understand

It is currently owned by [[Xes]] and can be stored within [[#The Pendant]]

#### The Pendant
The Pendant was also just a piece of apparel which Xes's acquired during zer time in [[Externa]], until [[#The Shade Cloak]] decided to possess the pendant after the [[Demon Of Space]] attacked [[The Dojo]] 

The Pendant had a chain made of black metal until the possesion upon which it converted to a cord/chain made of the same shadowy material as [[#The Shade Cloak]], it has a purple gem in the centre which when possessed has something flitting around inside, the main body of the Pendant is silvery in colour
