##### Related Groups/Factions
Xes is part of {Current Affiliated Groups}
##### Early Life
Xes was created in Externa by [UNKNOWN] (Like not even Xes knows) in 1988 [[Dexana]] time, they have a sibling called [[The Observant (OB)]]. Xes and zir sibling lived together conducting tests to assess the mental faculties and problem solving capabilities of the local population. During Xes's time in Externa where ze have spent most of their life, they acquired a pendant with a purple gem and black chain ([[The Shade Cloak and Pendant#The Pendant|See More]])
##### Physical Description/Attributes
Xes is 176cm/6'9" tall, has a slender build, ze have purple eyes but can change depending on emotion, they do not possess hair of any kind and has metallic grey skin, ze are currently missing their left hand
{Insert Apparel}
##### Training and Abilities
Xes is currently untrained in regards to combat but possesses knowledge in regards to medicine and construction of electronic 
[[The Shade Cloak and Pendant|The Shade Cloak]] is one of Xes’s main sources of power, the cloak can be stored within [[The Shade Cloak and Pendant|Xes's Pendant]]
They know several languages including English, Latin, Old Norse and sign language, if able to connect to their home database they can acquire more languages (But that won't be happening any time soon)
##### Family
Xes is not part of any family in the typical sense due to them being an android, they do have a creator and sibling though 
Their creator is [UNKNOWN] and their sibling is called The Observant. The Observant is similar to Xes in being an android but different in behaviour being less expressive and less 

##### Behaviours
Contact with considerable levels of heat will excite the plasmoid within Xes causing an excess of energy making zem more irrational and more energetic but their body temperature will remain at it's regular levels, contact will cosiderable levels of cold will cause the plasmoid to need to be used more while also making Xes more tired and sluggish and cause zer body temperature to increase as more plasmoid is consumed
Whenever plasmoid is consumed it is converted into matter which can be used to regenerate small injuries or can be converted into plasmoid for further use using special technology
##### Resistances and Weaknesses
They are fairly resistant to blunt force trauma, they can be thrown around and only come out with a couple of scratches, when cut they will begin to regenerate the area almost immediately, though this will become unviable after multiple injuries as the matter used to regenerate will be depleted
If they do manage to be cut in any shape or form then that can lead to complications such as water getting into their circuitry, hydraulics and inner mechanisms, the stable plasmoid (Yeah I know it isn't quite how to works but if ze come from a place with giant ships flying through the sky, I think this is fine) inside of them which flows like their blood can leak out and it it will need to be replaced using special technology, if said stable plasmoid comes into contact with water it will be diluted making Xes sluggish, the same will happen if too much of the stable plasmoid is lost, mental faculties will diminish and memory will follow suit, eventually ze will die once they lose enough
