##### Related Groups/Factions
Alice is part of the [[The Ink Creatures]] of J.Drew Studios and has been since she was hired as an actress for the character "Alice". 
##### Early Life
Alice grew up in Applewood. Other than this not much is known about how she lived in early life. What is known is that sometime in her mid-twenties, she was employed at [[J.Drew Studio]] and then was sacrificed to the [[Ink Machine]] to create the monster she is now. Even her birth name is largely unknown or unclear.
##### Physical Description/Attributes
Alice is 6ft tall in humanoid form, has a melted but vaguely curved cartoon build, she has black hair, pale skin, dark charcoal eyes. Because of her being an ink creature, and a corrupt one at that, the majority of her "body", while in a humanoid form, is melted and seemingly incomplete, she does have markings of what can be seen on the cartoonish end of things, like drawn lashes and smudged black lipstick. She is depicted wearing a dress that has been ripped and resewn over the years to perfect an image. Nowadays, in her resting place of [[The Dojo]]'s treasury, she's stuck in an ink-puddle form, to which she looks like a vat of black viscous liquid swirling around with hints of light from what remains of her soul.
##### Training and Abilities
While Alice is not an Ace nor participated in fighting of any kind, she trained as a skilled voice actress in life before being transformed into what she is now by [[Joey Drew]].
##### Family
As Alice has been stuck like this for so long, it's hard to pinpoint any family that she herself remembers.
##### Resistances and Weaknesses
Alice, as well as other ink creatures seem to have the innate ability to mix in and out of other liquids, but seem to be thinned out by the use of uncursed/regular ink. They seem to be resistant to heat up to 100C but after that starts boiling over.
