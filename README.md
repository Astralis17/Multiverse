#Complete 
Welcome to the Multiverse wiki hosted on GitHub

The is the how to for this little at home wiki 

The plan is that this will allow us to understand the impact and the effect of are actions while playing. 

Using obsidian as the writing and aspect of this and a GitHub repository to allow the complete transfer of files, all of this will be explained in the next section 

The wiki can be accessed online at https://multiverse-wiki.vercel.app, though it will be different in some regards due to limitations with the service
#### Actions
* This will automatically pull files on start-up, if you do not get a pull notification (either a download symbol on pc and a notification in app on mobile) try ether swiping up on Mobile or pressing ctrl+p and typing "Pull" on PC
	- If there is an error type "commit all" changes then ender and retry pulling ("Pull")
	- If there is still errors go scream at Aurora or something

* And if you wish to upload the changes that you have made to our corner of the internet, then all you have to do is enter the command "commit all" then "push"
