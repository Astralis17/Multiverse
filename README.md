this is the how to for this little at home wiki 

The plan is that this will allow us to understand the impact and the effect of are actions while playing. 

Using obsidian as the writing and aspect of this and a GitHub repository to allow the complete transfer of files, all of this will be explained in the next section 

Actions
* One this will automatically pull files on start up, if you do not get a pull notification (ether a download symbol on pc and a notification in app on mobile) try ether swiping up (mobile) or pressing ctrl+p and typing "Pull".
  If there is an error type "Commit All" changes then ender and retry pulling ("Pull")
* If there is still errors contact Aurora or Amber (Contact to Aurora first)
* And if you wish to upload the changes that you have made to are corner of the internet, then all you have to do is enter the command "Commit All" then "Push"
